    <p>
      From today's vc: @no ruin is going to do movement control. A irl meeting is going to be conducted at @part h (but gay) 's house in the forthcoming days @SC has completed 
      the coding of reciever, and @raju babu will beworking on the design when he will return home. @ivory_2601 will be there to help you all. Till now No one has asked to But
      I am Here.
    </p>

    <u><h3>Friday, June 7, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
    Today 7 June @SC @raju babu @ivory_2601 Went for shopping Parts bought today: 
      <ol type="1" style="padding: 0;">
        <li>Adruino Nano (2)</li>
        <li>NRF24 with antenna (1)</li>
        <li>NRF24 without antenna (1)</li>
        <li>Joystick module (2)</li>
        <li>Port B to USB cable (1)</li>
    karpe ‚Äî Today at 10:58 PM: This is the bill of the above mentioned items which mentions the amount 810. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kJi31rF.jpg?1" width="100" height="100">
    The item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is not mentioned as it was purchased after obtaining Microchip and cuz we didn't check while buying The cost of the item 5. Port B
    to USB cable (1) is 30/- INR.
    karpe ‚Äî Today at 11:06 PM: As of now @SC will be testing a few parts from the above mentioned list which include:
        <ol type="1" style="padding: 0;">
          <li>Adruino Nano (1)</li>
          <li>Joystick Module (1)</li>
          <li>Port B to USB cable (1)</li>
        </ol>
    @rawscientist has the remaining parts. He has posted a photo suggesting that the parts need to be cleaned up using "rubbing alcohol". I am "assuming" that he will be
    doing it by himself as I haven't received any update on it by him at the moment of writing this message.
    </p>

    <u><h3>Sunday, June 9, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
    @sc has completed the coding of transmitter. He has also completed testing of all the parts he had with him and performed tests bly completing the circuit for
    transmitter.
    </p>

    <u><h3>Monday, June 10, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
      The following parts were purchased by @rawscientist:
      <ol type="1" style="padding: 0;">
        <li>Data Cable (1)</li>
        <li>NRF24L01 3.3v Adapter Module (2)</li>
        <li>100ŒºF Capacitor (2)</li>
        <li>10ŒºF Capacitor (2)</li>
        <li>GPIO Header pin (8)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <u><h3>Tuesday, June 18, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
      @rawscientist has achieved partial radio communication.
    </p>

    <u><h3>Monday, July 1, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
        @rawscientist and @sc have achieved complete radio communication. They have successfully assembled transmitter module on PCB board!
    </p>

    <u><h3>Sunday, July 7, 2024</h3></u>
    <p>
        @rawscientist with the help of @nr's and @sc's code has succesfully tested the working of servo. The transmitter is giving the instructions properly while the receiver
      is capturing the movements of the server and showing proper output. The servo was wirelessly controlled using NRF24L01! <a style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"href="https://x.com/RAWscientists/status/1809912879140704360">Watch this video made by @rawscientist</a>

    <u><h3>Monday, July 9, 2024</h3></u>
    <p> 
        A vc was conducted today,  the topics discussed are:<br>
        <ul style="list-style-type">
          <li>The problem with NRF24L01 module with antenaa: The modules of transmtitter and receiver were replaced, as the NRF24l01 module with antenna wasn't transmitting data.
          @rawscientist then swapped the module with SMD module with antenaa which was placed in the reciever.</li>
          <li>The purchase of BLDC motor: The team needs to contribute for the money which will be needed to buy the motors. In total 5 motors need to be purchased, and everyone
          will try and find motors with the required specs and budget.</li>
          <li>Design of the VTOL: @NR and @ivory_26 will be looking at the designing of the vtol as well as the marterial. They will collaborate with one another for the same.</li>
        Another vc will be held tomorrow to discuss the purchase of BLDC Motors.
