          didn't check while buying The cost of the item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is 30/- INR. karpe — Today at 11:06

          @rawscientist has the remaining parts. He has posted a photo suggesting that the parts need to be cleaned up
          using "rubbing alcohol". I am "assuming" that he will be doing it by himself as I haven't received any update
