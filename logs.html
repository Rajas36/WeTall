        <p>Today 7 June <span class="user-name">SC</span>, <span class="user-name">Raw scientist</span>, <span class="user-name">IVORY</span> went for shopping Parts bought today:
          <ol>
          <li>Adruino Nano (2)</li>
          <li>NRF24 with antenna (1)</li>
          <li>NRF24 without antenna (1)</li>

          </ol>
          <span class="user-name">IVORY</span> — Today at 10:58 PM: This is the bill of the above mentioned items which mentions the amount 810. The
          item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is not mentioned as it was purchased after obtaining Microchip and cuz we
          didn't check while buying The cost of the item 5. Port B to USB cable (1) is 30/- INR. <span class="user-name">IVORY</span> — Today at 11:06
          PM: As of now <span class="user-name">SC</span> will be testing a few parts from the above mentioned list which include:
          <ul>
          <li>Adruino Nano (1)</li>
          <li>Joystick Module (1)</li>
          <li>Port B to USB cable (1)</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="user-name">Raw scientist</span> has the remaining parts. He has posted a photo suggesting that the parts need to be cleaned up
          using "rubbing alcohol". I am "assuming" that he will be doing it by himself as I haven't received any update
          on it by him at the moment of writing this message.

          Raw scientist with the help of NR's and SC's code has succesfully tested the working of servo. The transmitter is
           giving the instructions properly while the receiver is capturing the movements of the server and showing proper output.
           The servo was wirelessly controlled using NRF24L01!

          A vc was conducted today,  the topics discussed are:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>The problem with NRF24L01 module with antenaa: The modules of transmtitter and receiver were replaced, as the
                NRF24l01 module with antenna wasn't transmitting data.Raw scientist then swapped the module with SMD module with
                antenaa which was placed in the reciever.</li>
            <li>The purchase of BLDC motor: The team needs to contribute for the money which will be needed to buy the motors. In
                total 2 motors need to be purchased, and everyone will try and find motors with the required specs and budget.</li>
            <li>Design of the VTOL: NR and IVORY will be looking at the designing of the vtol as well as the marterial. They
                will collaborate with one another for the same.</li>
          </ul>
          Another vc will be held tomorrow to discuss the purchase of BLDC Motors.
